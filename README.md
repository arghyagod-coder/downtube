#### Setup

First you need to setup downtube for yourself

Procedure:

- Run `dtube config -dr <resolution>`to set your preferred default video resolution for download. You can check options for resolutions by executing `dtube config`

- Now you are set up to use downtube

**Most of the time only 360p and 720p videos support audio, so they are recommended over any other resolution**

##### Download video from search terms :

```
dtube dlyt {Search Terms} -r {resolution(optional)}
```

For example:

```
dtube dlyt Despacito_Song -r 360p
```
The first result from your search terms will be downloaded to your current folder

Giving a resolution is completely optional. If you dont provide it, the video will be downloaded in your default resolution.

**Most of the time only 360p and 720p videos support audio, so they are recommended over any other resolution**

##### Download video from URL

```
dtube dlvl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk' -r 360p
